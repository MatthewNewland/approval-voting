# Election for a 9-seat city council.
# Most in the city are Party A.
# B and C are the two minor parties, with B having
# more support than C.
# A runs 9 candidates, B runs 9, and C only 3, given
# they are a small portion of the population. But C voters vote only for C candidates
# to ensure they have the best chance of gaining representation.
# (With proportional approval voting, if you are in a minor party, it virtually never
# would make sense to vote for someone from a party other than your own party.)
